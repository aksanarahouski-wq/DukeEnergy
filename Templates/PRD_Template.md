- Keep Executive Summary brief
- Simplify User Stories section
- Omit Technical Design section
- Omit Rollout Strategy
- Omit Implementation Plan
- Omit Success Metrics
- Omot Next Steps
- Keep Testing Requirements high-level
- Focus on clear Acceptance Criteria

**For Medium Features**:
- Include all standard sections
- Technical Design can be brief
- Standard testing approach
- Clear implementation phases

**For Complex Features** (like Service Plan Enhancements):
